/**
* Median data structure implemented as a binary tree, the root always being the current median,
* the left subtree - a max heap and the right subtree - a min heap.
* When adding an element, it is pushed to either the min or max heap, depending on whether it is larger than the current median or not.
* This means that there is an inherent overhead of O(log n), as the new value has to be "sifted", to preserve the heap.
* This overhead though is less than what would be computationaly needed to for example keep a balanced binary search tree (as we don't need to pay for that)
*   and it is also more efficient than doing an O(n) insertion sort on each add.
*
* This is an online implementation that returns the current median in O(1) time, but takes O(log n) to add.
*
* The template allows any type, but before using it, it should be checked whether it is an arithmetic type.
